# StatServe
## A NodeJS based Static Site Server
Simple and easy to use. Drop your content in ```public/```, add in your Sendgrid API Credentials, and configure the email you want to receive from a contact form, and your set to go.

Great for Onepage sites and countdowns.

### TODO
* Create Tutorial
* Add option for Mandrill to replace Sendgrid
* Make contact form functions optional
* Create a CLI to quickly create and build static sites
* Add deployment functionality - Heroku, Nodejitsu, Modulus, Generic Git
